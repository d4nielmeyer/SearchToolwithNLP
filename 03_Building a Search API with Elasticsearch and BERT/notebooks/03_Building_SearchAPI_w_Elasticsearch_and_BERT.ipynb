A widespread endemic disease with a stable number of infected people is not a pandemic. Widespread endemic diseases with a stable number of infected people such as recurrences of seasonal influenza are generally excluded as they occur simultaneously in large regions of the globe rather than being spread worldwide.\\nThroughout human history, there have been a number of pandemics of diseases such as smallpox and tuberculosis. The most fatal pandemic in recorded history was the Black Death (also known as The Plague), which killed an estimated 75–200 million people in the 14th century. The term was not used yet but was for later pandemics including the 1918 influenza pandemic (Spanish flu). Current pandemics include COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) and HIV/AIDS.',\n",

Swine influenza virus (SIV) or swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) is any strain of the influenza family of viruses that is endemic in pigs. As of 2009, the known SIV strains include influenza C and the subtypes of  influenza A known as H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and H2N3.\\nSwine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide. Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to human flu, often resulting only in the production of antibodies in the blood. If transmission does cause human flu, it is called zoonotic swine flu. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection.\\nAround the mid-20th century, identification of influenza subtypes became possible, allowing accurate diagnosis of transmission to humans. Since then, only 50 such transmissions have been confirmed. These strains of swine flu rarely pass from human to human. Symptoms of zoonotic swine flu in humans are similar to those of influenza and of influenza-like illness in general, namely chills, fever, sore throat, muscle pains, severe headache, coughing, weakness, shortness of breath, and general discomfort.\\nIt is estimated that in the 2009 flu pandemic 11–21% of the then global population (of about 6.8 billion), or around 700 million to 1.4 billion people, contracted the illness—more in absolute terms than the Spanish flu pandemic.

       "     'text': 'Pandemic,Notable outbreaks,Major outbreaks in countries,Typhus\\nTyphus is sometimes called \"camp fever\" because of its pattern of flaring up in times of strife. (It is also known as \"gaol fever\" and \"ship fever\", for its habits of spreading wildly in cramped quarters, such as jails and ships.) Emerging during the Crusades, it had its first impact in Europe in 1489, in Spain. During fighting between the Christian Spaniards and the Muslims in Granada, the Spanish lost 3,000 to war casualties, and 20,000 to typhus. In 1528, the French lost 18,000 troops in Italy, and lost supremacy in Italy to the Spanish. In 1542, 30,000 soldiers died of typhus while fighting the Ottomans in the Balkans.\\nDuring the Thirty Years\\' War (1618–1648), about eight million Germans were killed by bubonic plague and typhus. The disease also played a major role in the destruction of Napoleon\\'s Grande Armée in Russia in 1812. During the retreat from Moscow, more French military personnel died of typhus than were killed by the Russians. Of the 450,000 soldiers who crossed the Neman on 25 June 1812, fewer than 40,000 returned. More military personnel were killed from 1500 to 1914 by typhus than from military action. In early 1813, Napoleon raised a new army of 500,000 to replace his Russian losses. In the campaign of that year, more than 219,000 of Napoleon\\'s soldiers died of typhus. Typhus played a major factor in the Great Famine of Ireland. During World War I, typhus epidemics killed more than 150,000 in Serbia. There were about 25 million infections and 3 million deaths from epidemic typhus in Russia from 1918 to 1922. Typhus also killed numerous prisoners in the Nazi concentration camps and Soviet prisoner of war camps during World War II. More than 3.5 million Soviet POWs died out of the 5.7 million in Nazi custody.',\n",

It has caused a cluster of cases of an acute respiratory disease, which is referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). According to media reports, more than 200 countries and territories have been affected by COVID-19, with major outbreaks occurring in Brazil, Russia, India, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, Western Europe and the United States.

       "     'text': 'Science diplomacy and pandemics,COVID-19\\nOn December 31, 2019, authorities in Wuhan, China reported the first cases of an unknown pneumonia to the World Health Organization (WHO). Shortly after that, on January 4, 2020, the WHO reported on social media that there had been a group of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China but that no deaths had been reported. The unknown pneumonia was a novel coronavirus, which they later named COVID-19. WHO quickly realized that it was a serious problem and issues between science and diplomacy on the topic of COVID-19 became evident. The Chinese government did not alert the WHO about the full extent of the seriousness of the outbreak.By the time the WHO realized that the problem was serious, the false information of a low mortality rate and its low risk to non-senior citizens had already spread very rapidly. The United States and the WHO tried to send scientists to help China fight COVID-19; however, China refused the help. China did eventually share the genome sequence of COVID-19 with the global community and later accepted another offer from the WHO to send a team of scientists to help. The lack of communication and the slow transmission of information between science and government caused failures to slow the spread of the virus in its early stages. To further complicate this stage, when scientists did give information or guidance, governments did not take it into proper consideration. As a result, by not acting fast enough, many people were infected and local economies suffered due to the slow decision to act in unison. The overall impact on society would have been less detrimental if governments had acted in collaboration with each other and scientists.Some progress has been made among the scientific community itself in creating transparency, so local scientists in each region have access to the information they need to fight COVID-19. For example, the global scientific community began making efforts to communicate and share relevant information to help combat COVID-19 without delay. The WHO reported that a global research roadmap has been created in March 2020 to fight COVID-19. Scientists are publishing research findings before they are peer-reviewed and sharing other discoveries without delay. Scientists and clinicians are working to fight the epidemic by sharing data through information sharing technologies using bioRxiv, medRxiv, ChemRxiv, and arXiv, which allows them to share information in real time. These tools are helping biopharma research and development, academic labs, government regulators, and the clinical community to speed up the process of testing new pathways to treating COVID-19 patients more efficiently. As one researcher explains, “We are experiencing a shift towards Open Science at a speed that was previously unthinkable. It began with the publication of the genetic sequence of COVID-19 by Chinese scientists in early January 2020 via GenBank – an open-access DNA database operated by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information”Additionally, The World Economic Forum has partnered with the WHO to mobilize and help supply the needed resources required to fight COVID-19 itself and the economic impact it is having. With the sharing of this information around the world by scientific communities, each individual country is better equipped with the knowledge they need to combat the pandemic and investigate possible treatments, testing, and vaccines. In the most current WHO published table of COVID-19 vaccines, there are 124 candidates that are in different stages of vaccine development.',\n",

They have been described as \"organisms at the edge of life\", since they resemble organisms in that they possess genes, evolve by natural selection, and reproduce by creating multiple copies of themselves through self-assembly. Although they have genes, they do not have a cellular structure, which is often seen as the basic unit of life. Viruses do not have their own metabolism and require a host cell to make new products. They therefore cannot naturally reproduce outside a host cell—although bacterial species such as rickettsia and chlamydia are considered living organisms despite the same limitation. Accepted forms of life use cell division to reproduce, whereas viruses spontaneously assemble within cells. They differ from autonomous growth of crystals as they inherit genetic mutations while being subject to natural selection. Virus self-assembly within host cells has implications for the study of the origin of life, as it lends further credence to the hypothesis that life could have started as self-assembling organic molecules.',\n",
